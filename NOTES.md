# Notes on ideas that do not fit anywhere else 

## To think about when doing experiments

 - [ ] Use less anchors and/or use bigger space
 - [ ] Measure start position and direction
 - [ ] Start always at the same point and navigate robot to the beginning of 
 the trajectory
 - [ ] Check the circle radius and the speed
 - [ ] Measure the anchors and robot height precisely
