## Dataset descriptions

### Lawnmower range-only data sets

Localization of an autonomous lawnmower using UWB-based ranging to access points of known locations, as published in the [paper](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2009/9/Final_5datasetsRangingRadios.pdf) *Djugash et al.: Navigating with Ranging Radios: Five Data Sets with Ground Truth*.

The [original website](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/projects/emergencyresponse/RangeData) of these data sets is broken, but we were given [this](https://panda.frc.ri.cmu.edu/projects/emergencyresponse/RangeData/download.html) alternative source by the administrators.
